# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-22)

**Core value:** 任何時刻、一個指令，立即看到所有訂閱的 AI CLI「現在還剩多少 session 額度、什麼時候 reset」。
**Current focus:** Phase 0 — Spike & Spine

## Current Position

Phase: 0 of 4 (Spike & Spine) — numbering starts at 0 because the Gemini spike is gating
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-22 — Roadmap created from research + requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Granularity=coarse → 5 phases (0 through 4); MVP mode → every phase ships a runnable binary, not a horizontal layer.
- [Init]: Phase 0 numbering preserved (not collapsed into Phase 1) because the Gemini go/no-go memo is gating — Phase 3 scope depends on its outcome.
- [Init]: ADP-05 (Gemini) is conditional — success criteria phrased to honor either spike outcome (ship full / stub with opt-in flag).
- [Init]: Foundational items (keyring-core + Secret<T> + ratatui panic hook + per-adapter Vec<Result> isolation) wired in Phase 1 BEFORE feature code, per research recommendation.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Phase 3 scope is gated by Phase 0 outcome (Gemini spike). Do not plan Phase 3 in detail until Phase 0 memo lands.
